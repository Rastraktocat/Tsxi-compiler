# Tsxi-compiler
This interpreter / compiler is built in the flat assembler language, an x86 assembler. In the early iterations the project was more like an interpreter because it was translating machine code to machine code. There are later iterations which I have worked on is more compiler focused and it is more standard like you have seen in gcc and other compilers.
